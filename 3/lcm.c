/*
	Write a function who takes two unsigned int as parameters and returns the 
	computed LCM of those parameters.

	LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) of two non-zero integers is the smallest postive
	integer divisible by the both integers.

	A LCM can be calculated in two ways:

	- You can calculate every multiples of each integers until you have a common
	multiple other than 0

	- You can use the HCF (Highest Common Factor) of these two integers and 
	calculate as follows:

		LCM(x, y) = | x * y | / HCF(x, y)
	
	| x * y | means "Absolute value of the product of x by y"

	If at least one integer is null, LCM is equal to 0.

	Your function must be prototyped as follows:

	unsigned int    lcm(unsigned int a, unsigned int b);
